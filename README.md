# Node Reference Create

Node Reference Create is an enhancement to the nodereference autocomplete widget
that allows users to reference non-existent nodes.

When no matching node is selected, the new nodes are automatically created
allowing for a seamless and intuitive user experience that is similar to free
tagging.
